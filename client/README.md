# Claim Student React Starter Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It has been scaled down and tweaked to provide some sensible and recommended 'best practices' integration for new React students. It includes appropriate linting, VS Code settings and `import` for 'normalize.css,' among other things. üí¶

**Testing and service workers are removed.**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## `yarn dep`

Creates an SVG **and** interactive HTML dependency graph for visualizing your project.

The HTML will automatically open up with `browser-sync`. You can click on the different parts of the graph and look at the code. üëèüèΩ

You can choose to include the SVG as part of your `commit` - maybe just for every '`master`' release? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
